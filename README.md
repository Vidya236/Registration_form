        This is the task given by "BHARAT INTERN" of Full Stack Web Development as an intern.For this we have to create a registration form using HTML,CSS,NodeJS and MonoDB.Ofcourse it is quite easier and also intresting.By using different sources and some of my personal experiences are helped me alot.
        By importing some modules in NodeJS like mongoose,express,body-parser, Establshing connection between local host and the  files, Giving inputs.These are all done in the NodeJS.Then in HTML as we know it is a simple and easier by creating classes and making styling in the CSS is super interesting.
